    <h1>The History of Basketball</h1>

    <h1>What is Basketball?</h1>
    <p>Basketball is a team sport played on a rectangular court by two five-player groups. Played primarily indoors when organized in leagues, basketball is often also played outdoors in less organized “pick-up” games. The objective of the game is to throw (shoot) a ball (called the basketball) through the top of a circular band (referred to as the rim) that has cord hanging around its circumference (with both being named the basket), which is itself attached to a backboard.
        Basketball is commonly also nicknamed “B-ball” and “hoops.” Men and women in all areas of the world and of all ages play basketball, making it one of the more popular organized sports. Some of the more popular professional basketball players in the United States have included Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Bird, Kobe Bryant, Wilt Chamberlain, Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal, Magic Johnson, LeBron James, Yao Ming, and Bill Russell. Whether the game is played for fun or money, basketball provides a healthy workout for the body because it is a fast paced sport that involves much running, jumping, rebounding, passing, dribbling, and various other beneficial physical activities.
        The objective of the game of basketball is to have scored more points at the end of a specified time period than the opposing team. This is done by shooting the basketball through a rim, which results in one, two, or three points being scored. Whether one wins or loses after completing a game of basketball, each player's strenuous activities results in a physically fit body. Regularly playing basketball also provides great workouts and good cardiovascular health. It also helps to control high blood pressure. For instance, the Mayo Clinic states, “Flexibility and strengthening exercises such as lifting weights are an important part of an overall fitness plan, but it takes aerobic activity to control high blood pressure. And you don't need to spend hours in the gym every day to benefit. Simply adding moderate physical activities to your daily routine will help. Any physical activity that increases your heart and breathing rates is considered aerobic exercise, including: …Active sports, such as basketball or tennis.”</p>

            <h1>when and who created basketball</h1>
            <p>American physical education teacher James Naismeth—who was employed by the Department of Physical Education at the School for Christian Workers (now known as Springfield College), in Springfield, Massachusetts—invented basketball in late 1891. The head of the department, Luther Gulick, had asked Naismeth to create a new game so students at the school would have an organized way to get physical activity during the long winter season. Thus, Naismeth coined the term “Basket Ball” (two words) for the game that he developed, which consisted of two nine-player teams whose players would use a soccer ball to throw at two half-bushel peach baskets fastened to the balcony railing, one at each end of the school's gymnasium. Thirteen rules were established by Naismeth for the eighteen boys to play their new game.
                For the United States, USA Basketball is the nonprofit governing body, which is within the FIBA, for national men's and women's basketball played in the country. Within the U.S. Olympic Committee, USA Basketball represents the United States in basketball for its men and women competitors. Further, the men's professional basketball league in the United States, which consists of thirty franchised clubs in the United States and Canada, is operated by the National Basketball Association (NBA). The NBA also functions under the auspices of USA Basketball. The World Basketball Association (WBA), which is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, is another international basketball organization. The WBA is a basketball league composed of players hoping to enter the NBA and other professional basketball leagues around the world. The WNBA, the professional women's league established in 1997, consists of twelve teams.

        <h1>How can basketball improve your health</h1>
        <p>The objective of a basketball game is to score as many points as you can by getting the ball through the hoop of the opposing team. So far that sounds pretty simple. But along the way you’re burning calories and building skills hand-eye coordination is just one. Catching rebounding missed shots is another skill that requires a great degree of full-body coordination, since you have to observe the ball and jump to grab it at the right moment. Dribbling, another basic basketball skill, allows you to train your motor skills. Once you’ve mastered hand-eye coordination, you’ll no longer have to look at the ball while dribbling.
            Basketball requires you to jump while playing, as well as running back and forth multiple times. In a basketball game, you rely on your body positioning and the ability to maintain that position when an opponent is pushing against you. This is why playing basketball can strengthen all parts of your body, especially your core muscles, neck, lower back, and arms.
            Basketball is a fast-paced mental game where you must develop the ability to quickly and accurately process what’s happening in the game so as to make the best decisions for your team. During the game, you must observe your teammates as well as opponents and anticipate their next move and respond accordingly. The more you play, the better chance you have of improving your decision making skills in real-life situations. Although basketball can be played alone, it’s much more fun to let your friends join in! Socializing with other players helps reduce stress and boosts your immune system. Don’t think of basketball as a competitive sport, consider it as an activity that allows you to meet other people who share common interests in creating a healthy lifestyle. What’s more, making good shots and being part of a good team can improve your self-esteem and confidence, which helps you feel more positive about yourself.
            Basketball, in its purest form, is essentially another aerobic exercise that helps you burn a great deal of calories. For each hour of basketball, you can expect to burn somewhere between 600-900 calories, depending on your weight and the intensity of your pace. Exercise is only boring if you make it so. Diversify your workouts and come up with a workout routine that is not only enjoyable, but also one that you can stick to.

          <h1>How has basketball changed</h1>
          <p>Basketball has changed over the years from its aggression to play .Today the NBA generates $7 billion in revenue per season, or about $245 million for each of the league's 30 teams. There isn't a team in the league that's worth less than $1 billion, and three teams are worth more than $3 billion, with the Knicks topping the heap with a $4 billion valuation. The league's 30 teams sell nearly 22 million tickets a year to fans who pack their stadiums to watch the 1,230 games the NBA puts on every year—82 per team with an average attendance of 17,884 per home game.
            From humble roots to big business, the NBA has undergone significant changes along the way. The last 50 years have been among the most dynamic and exciting in the league's history. Giants of the sport like Michael Jordan, Larry Bird, Dr. J, Kobe Bryant, and LeBron James have attracted throngs of loyal fans, spearheaded dynasties, and sold more tickets, shoes, jerseys, and cable packages than can be counted.

            <h1>Has basketball impacted many over the years</h1>
            <p>Thirteen years ago in Davos, Switzerland, David Stern, the visionary NBA commissioner, participated in a panel discussion, “Can a Ball Change the World?” That’s asking too much of a ball. But a ball has certainly helped over the generations, and there is every reason to believe that in these times of global despair it can do even more. For centuries, civilizations have held the ideals of politicians, economists, monarchs, nation-states and theologians as the epitome of nobility and importance. Yet, when differences arise, often propelled by strong personalities and financial unrest, anger, fear and wars erupt. Without another Tolstoy, or Gandhi, or Mandela, or Martin Luther King Jr., whose lives were shaped by the Sermon on the Mount, it is time to look elsewhere. Why not question the old pecking orders, in which expressions of art, beauty and sport are relegated to afterthoughts except as forms of release and entertainment? Why not look to the “ball” the basketball, a global common denominator that has established itself as a culture of progressive ideas, leadership and diversity?
